# JD's Hangout Bot (name unknown yet, for now known as JD Bot because I'm lazy and uncreative)

This will be a bot writen in Python as I'm wanting to take a crack on python.

## TODO:

- Add commands

## Setup:

- Run `pip install --user discord python-dotenv`
- Put the discord token in a `.env` in the root directory, or set as an environment variable
- do `python3 -m jdbot` and it will start.
